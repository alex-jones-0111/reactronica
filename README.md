# Reactronica

> Warning: Highly experimental. APIs will change.

React audio components for making music in the browser. Uses [ToneJS](https://tonejs.github.io/) under the hood.

Check out the demo:
https://unkleho.github.io/reactronica/

Strongly influenced by [React Music](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-music).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save reactronica
```

Note: Use React version >= 16.8 as [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are used internally.

## Usage

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { Song, Track, Instrument, Effect } from 'reactronica';

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Song tempo={90} isPlaying={false}>
        <Track
          // Array of several types
          steps={[
            // Note in string format
            'C3',
            // Object with note and duration
            {
              note: 'C3',
              duration: 0.5,
            },
            {
              note: 'D3',
              duration: 0.5,
            },
            // Array of strings for chords
            ['C3', 'G3'],
            null,
            null,
            // Array of objects for chords
            [
              {
                note: 'C3',
                duration: 0.5,
              },
              {
                note: 'G3',
                duration: 0.5,
              },
            ],
            null,
          ]}
          effects={[
            <Effect type="feedbackDelay" />,
            <Effect type="distortion" />
          ]}
          // Callback for every tick
          onStepPlay={(step, index) => {
            doSomething(step, index);
          }}
        >
          <Instrument type="polySynth" notes={[]} />
        </Track>
        <Track>
          <Instrument type="sampler" samples={{
            'C3': 'path/to/kick.mp3',
            'D3': 'path/to/snare.mp3',
            'E3': 'path/to/hihat.mp3',
          }} />
        </Track>
      </Song>
    );

## Development

```bash
# Start Reactronica component build watch
$ npm start
# To run example page, in new terminal:
$ cd example
# Link local version of Reactronica to example
$ npm link ../node_modules/react
# Start up!
$ npm start
# If you get a babel-eslint issue, create a .env file with SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true in ./example
```

## Known Issues

- Tone installed as dependency due to `Module not found: Can't resolve 'tone' in '/Users/kcheung/Development/unkleho/reactronica/dist'` issue in `website/`. Keep as both dependency and peer for now.
- Latest Tone (13.4.9) has this issue `Cannot assign to read only property 'listener' of object '#<AudioContext>'` due to `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55039122/why-does-tone-js-not-play-nice-in-a-svelte-component`. Sticking with 0.12.80 for now.
- Both Reactronica and example/ have their own test config. Would prefer if Reactronica took care of all tests, however react-scripts only allows testing within a src/ dir. Moving to jest and babel/@core etc is required. (3/6/19)
- If you get `Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component.`, have a look at https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14721. Try going into the examples folder and running `npm link ../node_modules/react`.
- If multiple effects are added, effects don't update unless they are removed in the order they are added. Could be an issue with `[...prevState.effects, effect]`.
